Welcome :) I am a PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at Johnson, Cornell University.

My research develops and applies methods from econometrics, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning in marketing contexts. My current work develops a framework for valid statistical inference using large language models. Substantively, my work examines consumer behavior in housing markets and consumer financial decision-making more broadly.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I spent five years in industry as a quantitative researcher in Seoul—first at NICE Pricing and Information, where I developed credit-risk and derivatives models, and later at December & Company Asset Management, where I designed machine-learning–based portfolio investment strategies. Working closely with data on credit, household consumption, and individual financial choices naturally led me to a deeper interest in how consumers make financial decisions—an interest that now shapes my substantive academic work.

I received an MS in Information Systems from KAIST and a BS in Computer Science and Engineering from UNIST.

Here are some list of things I believe in:
- "The greatest joy of research is recognizing, with clarity, what you don’t yet understand—and then, every so often, experiencing the rare moment when the unknown finally becomes clear." - *June Huh*
- "Research is a long conversation—and important, original ideas emerge from the slow accumulation of that conversation." - *June Huh*
- "The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it... yet it finally surrounds the resistant substance.” - *Alexander Grothendieck*
- "…put the cutting edge of the chisel against the shell and strike hard. If needed, begin again at many different points until the shell cracks—and you are satisfied." - *Alexander Grothendieck*
- "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man." - *George Bernard Shaw*, Man and Superman
- The Feynman Problem Solving Algorithm - Coined in jest by Nobel Prize-winning physicist, *Murray Gell-Mann*
    1. Write down the problem
    2. Think real hard
    3. Write down the solution
- "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." - *Albert Einstein*
- "He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how." - *Friedrich Nietzsche*
- "'Science progresses one funeral at a time.' The future depends on some graduate student who is deeply suspicious of everything I have said." - *Geoff Hinton*
- "If the result confirms the hypothesis, then you've made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you've made a discovery." - *Enrico Fermi*
